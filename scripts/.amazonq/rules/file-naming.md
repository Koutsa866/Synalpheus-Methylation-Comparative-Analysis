# File Path Naming Rule

When creating or suggesting file and directory names:
- NEVER use spaces in file or directory names
- Use underscores (_) or hyphens (-) instead of spaces
- Examples:
  - ✅ `results_data` or `results-data`
  - ❌ `results (1)` or `my data`
- Apply this to all new files, folders, and paths created in code
- When working with existing paths that have spaces, use temporary directories or workarounds
